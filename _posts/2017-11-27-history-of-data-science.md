#### What is Data Science?

Before diving into the history of Data Science a definition of data science is needed.  I wanted to look into the history of data science, but quickly realized that I had no idea what it was.  According to Investopedia, data science is “a field of big data which seeks to provide meaningful information from large amounts of complex data.  Data science combines different fields of work in statistics and computation in order to interpret data for the purpose of decision making”[[1]](#resources).

At first it feels like Data Science is just a new fancy way of talking about analyizing data.  We just need a few more data analysts to cover the growing amounts of data and they get to make some big decisions.  However, as I read more and more I found that the amounts of data that is starting to be collected is vast.  There is more data than any analyst or group of analysts could really do anything with in a timely manner without some help.  I found:

> "Data science incorporates tools from [multiple] disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful dat from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes.  The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming."[[1]](#resources).

Data science takes what most of the world knows as data analysis to a whole new level of awesome.  They are able to more easily sift through the vast amounts of data to get what they actually need out of it in a timely manner rather than looking and looking and only finding some of what they need.  Many have referred to all of the data as Big Data, which it is so much data has to be handled differently than the smaller amounts of data that has been received in the past.

#### When did Data Science begin to be a thing?

Now that we know what data science is, we can look a bit at its history.  As its main focus is on data and analysis it could have been around for a long time.  Although I am not sure this is the beginning several other sites mention Peter Naur as the first main user of “data science” as a term.  In a 1974 publication “Concise Survey of Computer Methods” he describes data science this way, “Data science is the science of dealing with data”[[2]](#resources). This seemingly simplistic definition just sounds again like what an analyst would do.  He takes this one step further and says, “A basic principle of data science is this: The data representation must be chosen with due regard to the transformation to be achieved and the data processing tools available. This stresses the importance of concern for the characteristics of the data processing tools.”[[2]](#resources).  This leads me to the deeper meaning that I feel data science is trying to create.  It’s the tools involved and the large amount of data involved that make it data science instead of just analysis.  Although, let’s face it, it’s still analysis of data, but the way it is done is changing and evolving.  Even Mr. Naur noticed it back in 1974, data was changing and how we viewed it needed to change as well. We needed more tools, programming and power, to be able to sift through the growing amounts of data we have.

#### How has Data Science evolved since then?

For a long while the idea of Data Science was combined and intertwined with both typical analytical processes and computer science.  They were one and the same thing.  It seemed that there has been a steady separation within the computer science world and in 2001 William S. Cleveland published "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics."  He lined out a plan here to help people to see that there is a separation between them and how it should be accomplished.  It was an action plan to help things expand into something better.  He felt that there had not been enough time and energy devoted to data science, not just analysis and not just computer science. “Without the stimulus of research devoted to innovation, progress in computing with data has been slower than it could be, and the creativity that exists within universities has had almost no influence”[[3]](#resources).  He knew that good research was happening in colleges and universities and it was not being utilized as much as it should or could be.  With the help of the researchers and students many great things could be accomplished and his plan was going to just that, push thing forward.[[3]](#resources)

Matthew A. Waller and Stanley E. Fawcett pulished a paper in 2013 titled “Data Science, Predictive Analytics, and Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform Supply Chain Design and Management”.  Although it’s focus is on supply chain management, it has some interesting points about Data Science and Big data.  It discusses further how the two are intertwined and build off of each other.  They briefly discuss how big data is so fast flowing and easy to access and store these days.  That more and more of it is being stored and still needs to be analyzed.  They mention how software companies are popping up with algorithms to help analyze all the data that is out there, which is what data science is all about, using the tools and resources we have to help us sift through the massive amounts of data we have been collecting.[[4]](#resources)

Also in 2013 Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett wrote “Data Science and its Relationship to Big Data and Data-Driven Decision Making”  They bring up the last step of the data science idea, that of decision making.  We take the time to analyze data to help us to make decisions based on the past, in hopes that we make better decisions in the future.   They say, “data science is a set of fundamental principles that support and guide the principled extraction of information and knowledge from data”[[5]](#resources)

#### What happens next?

I expect we shall continue to see data science grow.  As employers see their data growing and the need for more sophisticated measures of that data we will see a higher demand for data scientists.  This is a growing field that is still splitting off of older ideologies of statistics, data analysis, and computer science.  I am curious what it will grow into in the coming years and will be keeping an eye on it as it grows.
